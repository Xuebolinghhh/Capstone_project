# Capstone_project
This is the capstone project for IBM data science professional courses

In this project we will focus on using the location data to explore interesting problems in real world!

# Introduction/Business Problem

We assumed that we have a friend who wants to open a coffee shop in the capital city *manila* of the Philippines. We have to decide 
where or which neighborhoods have a greater development potential.
In order to answer this question, we have built a model get some recommendations where to start his/her business.

# Solutions
* Compare with cities we have analysed before such as New York City and the city of Toronto. Determine how similar or dissimilar 
  they are. Chose the much more similiar one as training sample to build our model.
  The first step of analyse you can find [here](https://github.com/Xuebolinghhh/Capstone_project/blob/main/The_Battle_of_Neighborhoods.ipynb)
  
* Another thing we believe is that any one of business venue does not exist alone, the existence of coffee shop tends to be influenced
  by some other types of shops. Therefore, we chose other types of shops as variables and the number of coffee shops in each eighborhood   as response. In this case, we utilized Regression model to predict the number of coffee shop in manila and compare with the
  existing number of coffee shopes currently. The difference of them can somehow display their development potential in the             future. This indicator can help us to determine an ideal location of coffee shop.
  The second step of analyse you can find [here](https://github.com/Xuebolinghhh/Capstone_project/blob/main/Location%20selection.ipynb)
